Cross-platform Vulkan renderer


The objective of this project was an in-depth exploration of VULKAN, driven by a core aim of mastering the fundamental abstractions within the API. The primary focus was on conceptualizing optimal approaches to interface with these abstractions. To realize this objective, the decision was made to construct a renderer featuring a unified interface for engaging with Graphics APIs. The deliberate design allows for interchangeability with other APIs like OpenGL, a move envisioned to facilitate the establishment of robust abstractions for seamless API interaction.

## Build
To configure the project with a default configuration simply run confuguration script:

```
bash confugure_linux_default.sh Release
OR
configure_windows_default.bat Debug
```
